KEYLOGGER WHICH SENDS EMAIL


1. Become Hitman and install python on your friends computer and then copy this code into a file and name that file with a *.pyw* extension.
2. Press windows+r and then type shell:startup and then press 'enter'.
3. A folder will open and then paste this file to that folder. If you do this, then the keylogger will automatically start with the computer.
4. On every hundred key-strokes, it will anonymously send you an e-mail with the last hundred keys, pressed by the user.
